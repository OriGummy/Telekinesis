A library to dynamicly set up cameras and screens and control the screens remotely by pointing at them.
Made with ❤️ at [OSHHack 12](https://oshhack12.devpost.com/).

# Components
Cameras - arbitrary machines running a python script (will be a web page in the future).
Screens - arbitrary machines running a webpage.
Server - one machine managing and integrating the 3D view of the space and determening where the user is pointing at.

All components talk to the server using a websocket connection.

# Demo
Running main.py starts a demo where pointing at a screen displays a hitmarker.

# Usage
_Coming Soon_

## Calibrating
Hitting `c` on the demo will start calibrating the screens & cameras one by one.
